## Enterprise Software Development Kit

Netfluid framework is more than an application server: is a toolbox to fast develop high complexity business apllication.
In the last ten years i developed many enterprise software and i built this framework mainly for me, filling it with what i didn't found everywhere else, adapting other open source application or writing thousands and thousands of sloc.
This software has undergone several changes, it was born as my own server side language six year ago, and seven realese after is became a complete framework to develop professional grade enterprise application even with a small team and short deadlines
