<p>
	NetFluid web applications can be compiled as libraries or as self-hosted application.
	<br/>
	Each webapp can contain unlimited virtual hosts running in the same C# AppDomain or you can set FastCGI forwarding on specific host-names.
	<br/>
	If no virtual hosts are specified, the current context is served by the default web application.
</p>
<p>
	The current assembly is always loaded as default web application
